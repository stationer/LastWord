            <h2>What is "Last Word"?</h2>
            <p>Last Word is a password management system that works by assigning
                passwords rather than storing them.  The advantage is that your
                passwords are not stored anywhere to be found.  The disadvantage
                is that you cannot choose your own passwords.  The process is
                simple, as discribed below:
            </p>
            <h2>1. Add the accounts you want to manage</h2>
            <p>You'll notice how the form does not have a field for your password --
                we do things a little different.  Enter the name of the Service
                you want to access, your username on that service, and the URL 
                of the login page (for your convenience).
            </p>
            <h2>2. Enter your Super-Secret Master Key</h2>
            <p>This Master Key is critical, make sure that it is not too simple,
                but still something you will never forget. If you forget this
                Master Key, there is no help for recovery. Be sure that no one
                else knows it, either, because changing your Master Key means
                changing all your passwords.
            </p>
            <h2>3. View your passwords here</h2>
            <p>After you have correctly entered your Master Key, your passwords
                are displayed in this table.  These passwords are NOT STORED
                ANYWHERE.  Not in our database, not in your computer, nowhere!
                Set your accounts to use these passwords, then you can always
                refer back to this list after providing the same Master Key
                that you used to create this list.
            </p>
            <p>Notice that entering an incorrect
                Master Key will still display passwords, they are just not the
                correct passwords.  Only you know when the correct passwords
                are displayed, because only you know your Master Key.
            </p>
            <p>To protect against people looking over your shoulder, passwords
                are obscured until you mouseover them, and a "copy" link is
                provided that will copy the password directly to the clipboard
                for you to paste into the service's login form.
