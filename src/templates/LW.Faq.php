            <h2>What is "Last Word"?</h2>
            <p>Last Word is a password management system that works by assigning
                passwords rather than storing them.  The advantage is that your
                passwords are not stored anywhere to be found.  The disadvantage
                is that you cannot choose your own passwords.
            </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>Three simple steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You provide a list of things you login to, including a 
                    Service name and a Username</li>
                    <li>You choose and enter a Master Key (Your Last Password)</li>
                    <li>LastWord performs some one-way hashing on the Service 
                        names, Usernames, and Master Key you provided.  The 
                        result is a unique and secure password for each listed
                        service.
                </ul>
            <p>Because the passwords are generated deterministicly from your
                information, you can come back and get the same generated 
                passwords by re-entering the same Master Key.
            </p>
            <h2>How secure is this, really?</h2>
            <p>Your passwords are not stored, they are rebuilt on your browser 
                each time you need them.  Your Master Key is not stored, you 
                tell it to LastWord, and it never saves it.  Only your list of 
                usernames is stored, so even if someone stole our entire server
                they would still not have anyone's passwords. So long as your 
                Master Key is kept secret, your passwords are safe.
            </p>
            <h2>What's the deal with those little colorful shapes?</h2>
            <p>Let's call that a pictohash.  The pictohash is generated from 
                your Master Key alone as a quick visual cue to whether you have
                entered it as you intended.  Since LastWord does not store your
                Master Key, this is the only way for us to help you know if you
                entered the correctly -- if the pictohash looks the same, the 
                Master Key is the same.
            </p>
            <h2>What if I want to change a password?</h2>
            <p>Simple!  Click on the 
                <img src="/^LastWord/images/down.png" alt="down">
                and <img src="/^LastWord/images/up.png" alt="up">
                arrows in the "Password #" column to choose a new password. The
                number specified here is added to the Service name, Username and
                Master Key when producing your password.  A different number 
                here, means a different password.
            </p>
            <h2>What if I want to change my Master Key?</h2>
            <p>That's fine, just enter a different value in the field next time,
                then, you'll have to change all your passwords.
